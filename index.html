        I have worked in the US Navy for 6 years and several industries before
        discovering I have a passion for technology. I am a curious developer
        always wanting to learn new technologies and programming languages. I
        have been told I have great attention to details when I am working on a
        project. I love to build and create, but beyond that I have a passion
        for developing software that solves everyday problems. In the future, I
        see myself in an organization that values collaboration, ethics, and
        room to grow both personally and professionally.
